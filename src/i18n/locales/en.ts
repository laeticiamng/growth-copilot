        question: "What is the 'Portable Company'?",
        answer: "It's a complete digital company you can 'carry' with you. 11 specialized departments (Marketing, Sales, Finance, Security...) work behind the scenes to deliver professional outputs. You just validate key decisions.",
      },
      q2: {
        question: "What's the difference between Full Company and À la carte?",
        answer: "Full Company gives you access to all 11 departments for €9,000/month. À la carte lets you choose only the departments you need (starting at €1,900/month per department). Core OS (Workspace, Approvals, Audit) is always included.",
      },
      q3: {
        question: "Is my data secure?",
        answer: "Absolutely. We use OAuth for connections (Google, Meta), your tokens are encrypted, and we never store your passwords. GDPR compliance guaranteed with export and deletion on request. Every action is logged in an immutable audit log.",
      },
      q4: {
        question: "How does the approval system work?",
        answer: "Any risky action (publishing, budget changes, sending emails) goes through your approvals inbox. You see exactly what will be done, the risk level, and you validate or reject with one click. Nothing is executed without your explicit agreement.",
      },
      q5: {
        question: "Do I need to configure technical tools?",
        answer: "No. Everything is managed behind the scenes. You answer a few simple business questions, authorize access to your accounts (Google, Meta) if desired, and that's it. No technical jargon, no complex setup.",
      },
      q6: {
        question: "What is the 'Premium Competence Standard'?",
        answer: "It's our quality commitment. Every output is structured, based on concrete data, and ready for decision-making. No guessing: if information is missing, we tell you clearly and ask for the minimum required.",
      },
      q7: {
        question: "Can I cancel anytime?",
